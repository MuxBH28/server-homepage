  Change the `url` variable in the script if your server IP or port is different.
  ```js
  let url = "http://192.168.1.50:6969/api/system"
  ```
- **Colors:**
  Adjust the `addLine` function color codes for CPU, RAM, Temperature, Download, and Upload.
- **Fonts & Sizes:**
  Edit `Font.mediumSystemFont(size)` or `Font.boldSystemFont(size)` to increase readability.
- **Layout:**
  Change `w.presentMedium()` to `w.presentSmall()` or `w.presentLarge()` to preview in different widget sizes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure that your **iPhone is connected to the same network as your server**, or make sure your API is **accessible remotely** if you want to view it outside your LAN.
- Widgets on iOS **refresh in the background every 15-30 minutes**, so real-time updates are not guaranteed.
- If the widget **doesn‚Äôt update**, manually open **Scriptable** and run the script to force a refresh.
