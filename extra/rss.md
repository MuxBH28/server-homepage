# RSS Feed Guide

## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows users to receive updates from websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Instead of visiting each site manually, you can subscribe to its RSS feed and get the latest content delivered automatically.

## What is it used for?

RSS is commonly used to:

- Stay updated with news websites, blogs, podcasts, and other frequently updated content.
- Aggregate multiple sources into a single feed reader or dashboard.
- Automate content monitoring without relying on social media algorithms.

In **Server Homepage**, the RSS widget is located in the **Tools** section.
From the **Settings** panel, you can change the RSS feed link to any source you prefer. This allows you to customize the dashboard with news or updates relevant to you.
