# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Whether you're here to report a bug, suggest a feature, or submit code â€” you're welcome. Contributions from the community help make this project better for everyone.

## Who Can Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute. However, submitted code must meet a certain quality threshold to be accepted. Pull requests may be rejected if they don't align with the project's standards or direction.

## How You Can Help

You can contribute in several ways:

- Report bugs
- Suggest new features
- Submit code improvements (frontend/backend)
- Help improve documentation

Note: All contributions must build upon the existing structure. Fundamental changes to the project's architecture will not be accepted.

## Contribution Process

1. Start with an Issue
   Before submitting a pull request, please open an issue describing your idea or bug. This helps decide whether the contribution aligns with the project's goals.
2. Write in English
   All communication, code comments, and documentation must be in English.
3. Describe Your Changes Clearly
   When submitting a pull request, include a detailed description of what was added, changed, or fixed. The more context, the better.
4. Respect the Project's Direction
   Contributions should extend existing functionality, not replace or restructure core components.
